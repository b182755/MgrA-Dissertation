## Introduction

This code provides various functionalities that are useful for completing a molecular docking simulation on a large scale library of ligands, specifically for UniDock and AutoDock-GPU.

## Features


- Preprocessing - preparing of files for docking simulation and ensuring correct file type to run the docking.
- Docking - Scripts that automate the docking procedure on a large library scale, where manual input is not possible.
- Analysis - Scripts that were used post docking to extract results from docking files, and rank compounds based on certain attributes assigned to them during the simulation.
- File Conversion - Other scripts created to streamline docking/easily convert between large quantities of file types for various analysis or secondary docking runs
